Summary of the Excel Bike Buyers Analysis

The analysis aimed to identify key factors influencing customer bike purchases by examining demographic, economic, and lifestyle data. The goal was to generate insights to support strategic marketing decisions and improve sales performance.

Initial steps involved cleaning and organizing the data, standardizing categories like marital status and commute distance, and creating an Age Bracket column to group customers into Adolescent, Mid Age, and Old categories. Pivot tables were then used to summarize trends across variables such as gender, marital status, income level, region, and occupation.

Visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, revealed key insights: Mid-aged single males had the highest purchase rates, and those with moderate incomes were most likely to buy. Short-distance commuters and homeowners also showed a higher likelihood of purchase.

An interactive dashboard with slicers allowed users to filter and explore the data dynamically. This tool highlighted customer segments and behavioral patterns that aligned with the projectâ€™s objectives. Overall, the analysis turned raw data into actionable insights, empowering the business to make informed, data-driven marketing decisions.

Recommendation: Target mid-aged, single professionals in urban regions, focusing on affordability and convenience for short-distance commuting.
